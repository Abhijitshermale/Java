1. keywords working :

	try: In try block we write statements that can throw exception i.e. it mentains risky code 
	catch: It mentains exception handling code i.e. alternative way for exception
	finally: It mentains clean up code i.e. closing the resources 
	throw: It creates exception object manually (by programmer) and handover to JVM

2. We can throw either checked or unchecked exception but throw is best for customized exception

3. We can only throw class that comes in throwable child class

4. We cannot write any statement after throw, otherwise it will provide unrechable statement error.
